pdf = """ Ethnic boundary crossing takes two different forms that have distinct
triggers,
traits, and potential outcomes: transitory crossing, which is typically short-term,
reversible, and triggered by microcontextual cues, and durable crossing, which is a
longer-lasting, gradual process motivated by macropolitical forces such as social
movements and government policies. This theoretical distinction helps explain the
unexpected growth in the long stigmatized self-identified indigenous population in
Mexico, which has tripled since 2000. Using a demographic projection model, the authors
find that natural demographic processes contributed little to this sudden growth.
Instead, using experimental and census data, they find that transitory crossing into
the indigenous category was activated by phrasing changes to the 2010 census
identification question. The authors theorize that durable crossing is being
simultaneously activated by the growing salience of the indigenous movement and the
Mexican governmentâ€™s embrace of multiculturalism. These political factors appear to
be shaping the social meaning of indigeneity itself."""
